		    			<h2>What is craft beer?</h2>
		    			<p>The Brewer's Association in Boulder, Colorado defines 'craft beer' as beer made by a brewer that is small, independent, and traditional.</p>
	<p>This sums it up rather nicely and for the association, it creates a good foundation so drinkers know what they are talking about.</p>
	<p>However, there is some very good beer being made today by brewers that don't exactly fit these qualifications. So, it should be pointed out that just because beer is or is not considered 'craft beer,' this does not mean that the beer is good (or not).</p>
	    			</div>
	    			<div class="page-b">
	    				<img src="images/history.jpg">
	    				<p>Steps in the brewing process include malting, milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging. </p>
	    				<p>There are three main fermentation methods, warm, cool and spontaneous. Fermentation may take place in an open or closed fermenting vessel; a secondary fermentation may also occur in the cask or bottle.</p>
	    				<p>There are several additional brewing methods, such as barrel aging, double dropping, and Yorkshire Square.</p>

	    	<div class="history">
	    		<p>We have been a pioneer in the craft beer industry since opening our original Arbor Brewing Company Pub and Eatery in downtown Ann Arbor, MI in July of 1995.  Our commitment to handcrafted beer, exceptional hospitality, local sourcing, community involvement, and environmental stewardship has been the foundation for our growth and success for nearly two decades.</p>
	    		<p>ABC was founded by husband and wife team Matt and Rene Greff who share a passion for beer and adventure.  By their late 20s the Greffs had become disenchanted with their corporate gigs and soon after brewpubs were legalized in Michigan, they set about opening their own brewery.  They raised their startup capital through a network of friends, family, and co-workers and became the first brewpub to open in Ann Arbor and the fifth to open in Michiganâ€™s fledgling microbrewery movement.</p>
	    		<p>Somehow we survived the trials and tribulations of our first few rocky years in business and by 2001 we had maxed out capacity on our 7 bbl system and were looking for ways to add new tanks.  Fortune was on our side when an adjacent building became available and we set about expanding our operations with the addition of a small banquet space, an additional 30 bbls of fermentation and serving tank capacity.</p>
